# Dust-Born
A game in development based in the desert in the year 0. The main characters name is Jeremiah and he wanders the desert fighting with Roman soldiers, beasts, enemy tribes and monsters. Will he ever find love? Will he die alone like the prophecies foretold? I am looking to add combat mechanics, decision making structures, romance options, survival.
